# This is my CSS file for stroke risk app. I wanted to make it look like a real medical app while keeping it simple and clear.
# I'll probably add more styles later as I build new features.


# For the page background I found a nice hospital image and made it stay fixed when scrolling - looks way better than a plain color.

    background-attachment: fixed;
}


# I made a simple blue navigation bar at the top. Blue looks medical and professional, and I can always add more buttons here later.
.nav { 
    background-color: #234567;
    padding: 15px;

# The main content needs to stand out from the background but not completely block it, so I made it white with a bit of transparency.
